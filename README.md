# The Golden Goose

A farmer owned a goose that laid one golden egg every day.
At first, he was grateful and sold the eggs for a good life.
Soon, he grew greedy and wanted all the gold at once.
He thought the goose must be full of golden eggs inside.
So he killed it and cut it open.
But there was nothing — just an ordinary goose.
In his greed, he lost everything.
